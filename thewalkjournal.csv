I have finally reached my destination with a feeling of great relief. After my 2705 meter walking journey, I am feeling exhausted but satisfied and content. The clear sky weather was glorious and the sun shone brightly on my journey, yet the air was still cool and refreshing. The sight of Gral. José Gervasio Artigas 469, C1406ABE CABA, Argentina was a beautiful sight and I am so grateful to have made it here in one piece.

Today I was out for a walk on a beautiful day in the sun. The sky was so clear and blue; it seemed to stretch on forever. The sun was shining brightly, the air was cool and the breeze was gentle. I walked along the road for 2566 meters until I reached Nicasio Oroño 1473. The streets were so peaceful, and the homes were quaint and inviting. I stopped for a few moments to take in the view, feeling so tranquil and content. I'm so glad I took this walk today, it was really a wonderful and refreshing experience.
