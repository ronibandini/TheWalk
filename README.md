# TheWalk
Renowned Polish-American philosopher and engineer, Alfred Korzybski, once famously declared, "The map is not the territory." For generations, this profound statement has shaped our comprehension of human perception and cognition. However, as we venture into the realms of cyberspace, machines, and robots, we must ask: Does this axiom still hold true? Within this  context, "The Walk," is a virtual walking machine harnessing geolocation, weather data, and generative Artificial Intelligence to explore the evolving landscape of human-machine interaction.
